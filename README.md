# Files for Data Acquisition System
- The sensors_revf is the most recent version of the code for the DAQ. It includes multiple cpp files to work with different sensors to create a DAQ that can handle multiple strain gauges, an accelerometer, and GPS. This was used on a raspberry pi and then used for flight testing on a blackhawk helicopter.
- It also is currently in progress especially the the pcb files.
